# SURAKSH — AI & Swarm-Intelligence Defence Digital Twin

**An integrated AI-driven defence digital twin that simulates ammunition & logistics, drone swarms, environment, and acoustic gunshot detection — providing adaptive mission planning, risk prediction, and real-time decision support.**

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern defence operations require coordinated action across logistics, ISR (drones), and environmental awareness. Siloed models lead to slow, brittle responses to ambushes, weather, or hostile actions. Timely detection of kinetic events (like gunfire) is critical for rapid reaction. There is a need for a **single, adaptive platform** that models these domains together and uses AI (swarm intelligence + ML) to autonomously replan and reduce mission risk.

## 2. Solution Overview (Suraksh)

Suraksh is a browser-first 3D digital twin and AI platform that integrates four tightly-coupled modules:

1. **Ammunition & Logistics Twin (ANTS / ACO)** — convoys modeled as ant-like agents using Ant Colony Optimization to find safe, efficient routes and adapt to threats.
2. **Drone Swarm Twin (BIRDS / Boids + MARL)** — drones use flocking + multi-agent RL to cooperatively surveil, detect threats, and assist logistics.
3. **Environmental Twin (FISH / PSO & Predictive ML)** — dynamic weather and terrain simulation that impacts operations; AI predicts environment-driven disruption.
4. **Gunshot Detection Module (ACOUSTIC ML)** — acoustic ML detects gunshots, classifies sound events, produces event confidence + approximate location; feeds directly into the twin to trigger autonomous responses.

All modules operate under a **Swarm Intelligence** paradigm and are visualized in **Babylon.js** with a React dashboard. AI is the integrator: detections (gunshots, drone sensor reports, weather alerts) cause pheromone updates, swarm reconfiguration, and optimized rerouting.
Drone Swarm (Swarm Intelligence + Boids / RL)

Goal: Autonomous UAV swarm coordination for surveillance, attack, and escort missions.

Core Algorithms:

Boids Model (Craig Reynolds) → simple rules: separation, alignment, cohesion.

Swarm Intelligence (Particle Swarm Optimization / Multi-Agent RL) → adaptive coordination.

Inputs:

Drone GPS positions, velocities, headings

Mission waypoints & enemy radar zones

Outputs:

3D real-time positions

Communication graph (who talks to who)

Collision-free adaptive swarm formation

Babylon.js Role: Render 3D drones (meshes/particles) flying dynamically.

Backend Role (Flask): Compute updated positions using the Boids / RL model and broadcast via Socket.IO.

2️⃣ Convoys & Ammunition Logistics (Ant Colony Optimization - ACO)

Goal: Efficient movement of convoys carrying ammunition, fuel, or medkits in a hostile terrain.

Core Algorithm:

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) → finds shortest safe path considering enemy threat zones, terrain cost, and resupply points.

Inputs:

Terrain map grid (cost matrix: roads, forests, rivers)

Threat map (enemy sniper/gun ranges)

Outputs:

Optimal convoy route (polylines in 3D)

Logistics metrics: ETA, fuel consumption, risk factor

Babylon.js Role: Animate convoy trucks/tanks following optimized paths.

Backend Role: Run ACO on maps, recompute routes in real-time if threats appear.

3️⃣ Environment & Terrain Effects (Predictive ML + PSO)

Goal: Simulate battlefield environmental conditions (wind, visibility, weather impact).

Core Algorithms:

Predictive ML Models (LSTM / Random Forest) for forecasting weather patterns.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) → optimizes unit movement under uncertain terrain.

Inputs:

Weather sensor streams (wind speed, temperature, rainfall)

Terrain data (elevation, mud, snow)

Outputs:

Real-time battlefield conditions overlay

Alerts (e.g., “High wind → drone altitude adjustment required”)

Babylon.js Role: Dynamic environment visuals → fog, lighting, rain, snow, terrain shading.

Backend Role: Stream environment states + predictive updates.

4️⃣ Gunshot Detection (Acoustic ML Model)

Goal: Real-time detection and localization of gunfire on the battlefield.

Core Algorithms:

Machine Learning / Deep Learning on acoustic signatures (CNN/RNN).

Triangulation using multiple sensor nodes.

Inputs:

Microphone sensor arrays (audio waveforms)

Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between sensors

Outputs:

Gunshot classification (AK-47, sniper, handgun, artillery)

3D position of gunfire source

Babylon.js Role: Visualize yellow sphere or red flash at detected gunfire location.

Backend Role: Preprocess audio → classify gunshot → compute coordinates → push to frontend.

Integration Flow
